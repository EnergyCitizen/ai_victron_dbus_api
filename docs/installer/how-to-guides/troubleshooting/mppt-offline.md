# How-To: Troubleshoot MPPT Offline

**Status**: 🚧 Coming Soon

This guide is planned for future implementation.

## Problem

Solar charger (MPPT) shows as offline or not producing power.

## What This Will Cover

- Checking PV voltage and connection
- Verifying VE.Can/VE.Direct communication
- Testing MPPT error codes
- Night vs fault detection

## Common Causes

- **Night time**: MPPT offline is normal (no sun)
- **Low PV voltage**: Panels disconnected or shaded
- **Communication loss**: VE.Can cable issue
- **MPPT fault**: Hardware failure or error code

## For Now

- [Battery Not Charging](./battery-not-charging.md) - Related charging issues
- [Validate New Installation](../../tutorials/01-validate-new-installation.md) - System validation
- [Alarm Codes](../../reference/alarm-codes.md) - Error code lookup

## Coming Soon

- API paths to check MPPT state
- Voltage measurement guide
- Common error code solutions
