# How-To: Check System Health

**Status**: 🚧 Coming Soon

This guide is planned for future implementation.

## Problem

Need to perform a comprehensive system health check.

## What This Will Cover

- Complete system health checklist
- Checking all subsystems (battery, inverter, MPPT, grid)
- Identifying potential issues before they cause failures
- Creating health reports

## Health Check Areas

- **Battery Health**: SOH, cell balance, temperature
- **Inverter Health**: Temperature, load balance, efficiency
- **Grid Connection**: Voltage, frequency, stability
- **Solar Production**: Expected vs actual output
- **Communication**: All devices responding
