# Reference: Current Limit Settings

**Status**: 🚧 Coming Soon

This guide is planned for future implementation.

## What This Will Cover

- Input current limit configuration
- Charge current limit settings
- How current limits affect system behavior
- Troubleshooting current limit issues

## Current Limit Types

- **Input Current Limit**: AC input from grid/generator
- **DC Charge Current**: Total charge current to battery
- **DVCC Charge Current**: BMS-controlled limit
- **AC Output Current**: Maximum inverter output

## Why It Matters

Current limits affect:
- Charging speed
- Load balancing in parallel systems
- Battery protection
- Compliance with installation limits

## For Now

- [DVCC Control System](../concepts/dvcc-control-system.md) - DVCC current limiting
- [Battery Not Charging](../how-to-guides/troubleshooting/battery-not-charging.md) - Charge limit problems

## Coming Soon

- Current limit configuration tables
- Calculation methods
- Parallel system considerations
- API paths for limits
