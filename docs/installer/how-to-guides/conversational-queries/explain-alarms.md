# How-To: Explain Alarms in Plain Language

**Status**: 🚧 Coming Soon

This guide is planned for future implementation.

## Problem

- Getting root cause analysis
- Understanding alarm severity
- Receiving action recommendations

## Example Queries

- "What does alarm #42 mean?"
- "Why did the high voltage alarm trigger?"
- "Explain all active alarms"
- "What should I do about this alarm?"

## For Now
