# How-To: Compare Site Performance

**Status**: 🚧 Coming Soon

This guide is planned for future implementation.

## What This Will Cover

- Side-by-side comparison of multiple VRM installations
- Normalizing metrics across different system sizes
- Identifying performance outliers
- Generating comparative reports

## Problem

You manage 50+ solar installations and need to:
- Compare site efficiency
- Identify underperforming systems
- Benchmark against fleet average
- Find systems needing maintenance

## For Now

- [Aggregate Alerts](./aggregate-alerts.md) - Fleet-wide alerting
- [Identify Underperformers](./identify-underperformers.md) - Find problem sites

## Coming Soon

- Code examples for multi-site queries
- Normalization techniques for different system sizes
- Visualization recommendations
- Performance KPIs and benchmarks
