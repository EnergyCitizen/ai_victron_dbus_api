# Reference: Grid Quality Thresholds

**Status**: 🚧 Coming Soon

This guide is planned for future implementation.

## What This Will Cover

- Acceptable voltage ranges by region
- Frequency tolerance limits
- Power quality metrics (THD, power factor)
- Grid code compliance thresholds

## Quick Reference (Coming Soon)

- Voltage ranges: EU (230V ±10%), US (120V/240V ±5%)
- Frequency ranges: EU (50Hz ±0.2Hz), US (60Hz ±0.1Hz)
- THD limits
- Power factor requirements

## For Now

- [Detect Grid Issues](../../how-to-guides/anomaly-detection/detect-grid-issues.md) - Implementation
- [Grid Code Standards](../../../installer/concepts/grid-code-standards.md) - Standard overview
- [Critical Paths](../api/critical-paths.md) - Grid monitoring paths

## Coming Soon

- Region-specific threshold tables
- Grid code mapping by country
- Power quality measurement methods
- Alert threshold recommendations
