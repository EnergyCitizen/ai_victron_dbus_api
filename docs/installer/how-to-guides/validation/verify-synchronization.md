# How-To: Verify Synchronization

**Status**: 🚧 Coming Soon

This guide is planned for future implementation.

## Problem

Need to verify parallel inverters or grid connection are properly synchronized.

## What This Will Cover

- Checking voltage match between sources
- Verifying frequency synchronization
- Phase alignment in 3-phase systems
- Detecting sync issues before they cause problems

## Why It Matters

Poor synchronization causes:
- Circulating currents
- Inverter overheating
- Reduced efficiency
- System instability

## For Now

See related:
- [Parallel Inverter Operation](../../concepts/parallel-inverter-operation.md) - Understanding sync
- [Inverter Load Imbalance](../troubleshooting/inverter-load-imbalance.md) - Sync-related issues
- [Validate New Installation](../../tutorials/01-validate-new-installation.md) - Initial sync check

## Coming Soon

- Voltage/frequency measurement procedures
- Acceptable tolerance values
- Phase checking methods
- Sync troubleshooting flowchart
