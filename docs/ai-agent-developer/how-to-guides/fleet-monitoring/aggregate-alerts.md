# How-To: Aggregate Alerts Across Fleet

**Status**: 🚧 Coming Soon

This guide is planned for future implementation.

## What This Will Cover

- Collecting alerts from multiple VRM installations
- Prioritizing critical vs warning alarms across fleet
- Aggregating similar issues (e.g., 5 sites with grid problems)
- Creating fleet-level dashboards

## Problem

With 50+ installations, you need to:
- Avoid alert fatigue from individual site alarms
- Prioritize which sites need immediate attention
- Identify systemic issues affecting multiple sites
- Manage escalation efficiently

## For Now

See related:
- [Compare Site Performance](./compare-site-performance.md) - Compare individual sites
- [Critical Paths Reference](../../reference/api/critical-paths.md) - Key monitoring paths
- [Detect Grid Issues](../anomaly-detection/detect-grid-issues.md) - Grid-wide problems

## Coming Soon

- Alert aggregation algorithms
- Priority scoring systems
- Dashboard design patterns
- Notification routing logic
