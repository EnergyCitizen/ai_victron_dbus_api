# How-To: Check Battery Health

**Status**: 🚧 Coming Soon

This guide is planned for future implementation.

## Problem

Need to verify battery health during installation or maintenance visit.

## What This Will Cover

- Checking State of Health (SOH)
- Verifying cell balance
- Testing capacity vs specification
- Identifying degradation early

## Key Health Indicators

- **SOH**: Should be >95% for new batteries
- **Cell voltage spread**: <50mV is good, >100mV needs attention
- **Temperature**: All cells within 5°C
- **Capacity**: Actual vs rated

## For Now

- API paths for health metrics
- Acceptable value ranges
- When to recommend replacement
