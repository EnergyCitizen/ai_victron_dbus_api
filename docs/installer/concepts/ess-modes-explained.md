# Concept: ESS Modes Explained

**Status**: 🚧 Coming Soon

This guide is planned for future implementation.

## What This Will Cover

- Detailed explanation of each ESS mode
- When to use each mode
- How modes affect battery and inverter behavior
- Mode transitions and their impact

## ESS Modes (Brief)

- **Optimized (with BatteryLife)**: Default, extends battery life
- **Optimized (without BatteryLife)**: Maximum self-consumption
- **Keep batteries charged**: Grid backup priority
- **External control**: MQTT or Modbus control

## Why It Matters

Choosing the wrong ESS mode can:
- Shorten battery life
- Increase electricity costs
- Cause system instability
- Reduce backup time

## For Now

- [ESS Mode Reference](../reference/ess-modes.md) - Quick lookup table
- [Battery Not Charging](../how-to-guides/troubleshooting/battery-not-charging.md) - ESS-related charging issues

## Coming Soon

- Detailed mode descriptions with diagrams
- Decision tree for mode selection
- Real-world configuration examples
- Performance comparison data
