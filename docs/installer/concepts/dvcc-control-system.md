# Concept: DVCC Control System

**Status**: 🚧 Coming Soon

This guide is planned for future implementation.

## What This Will Cover

- What DVCC (Distributed Voltage and Current Control) does
- How DVCC coordinates charging from multiple sources
- When to enable DVCC
- DVCC settings and their effects

## What is DVCC?

DVCC is Victron's system for:
- Coordinating charge current from solar, AC charger, alternator
- Enforcing battery voltage limits set by BMS
- Preventing overcharging or over-discharging
- Managing charge priorities

## Why It Matters

DVCC is essential for:
- Lithium battery safety
- Multi-source charging coordination
- BMS integration
- Battery warranty compliance
