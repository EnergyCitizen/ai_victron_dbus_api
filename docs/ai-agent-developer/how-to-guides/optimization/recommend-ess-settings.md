# How-To: Recommend ESS Settings

**Status**: 🚧 Coming Soon

This guide is planned for future implementation.

## What This Will Cover

- Analyzing usage patterns to optimize ESS configuration
- Recommending grid setpoint adjustments
- Suggesting battery charge/discharge schedules
- Optimizing for cost vs battery life tradeoffs

## Problem

ESS configuration is complex:
- What grid setpoint should I use?
- Should I enable grid feed-in?
- How to balance battery life vs energy savings?
- When to switch between ESS modes?
