# Concept: Grid Quality Metrics

**Status**: 🚧 Coming Soon

This guide is planned for future implementation.

## What This Will Cover

- Understanding power quality measurements
- Key metrics: voltage, frequency, THD, power factor
- How grid quality affects solar systems
- Why monitoring grid quality matters for AI agents

## Why It Matters

Poor grid quality causes:
- Inverter disconnections
- Reduced system efficiency
- Equipment wear
- Compliance issues

## For Now

- [Grid Thresholds](../reference/thresholds/grid-thresholds.md) - Threshold values
- [Grid Frequency Issues](../../installer/how-to-guides/troubleshooting/grid-frequency-issues.md) - Troubleshooting

## Coming Soon

- Detailed metric definitions
- Measurement methodologies
- Impact analysis
- Regional standards comparison
