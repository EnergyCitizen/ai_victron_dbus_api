# How-To: Validate Grid Connection

**Status**: 🚧 Coming Soon

This guide is planned for future implementation.

## Problem

Need to verify grid connection is stable and within specifications.

## What This Will Cover

- Measuring grid voltage and frequency
- Checking power quality (THD, flicker)
- Verifying grid code compliance
- Testing under load

## Critical Checks

- **Voltage**: Within ±10% of nominal (EU) or ±5% (US)
- **Frequency**: Within ±0.2Hz (50Hz) or ±0.1Hz (60Hz)
- **THD**: <5% for good quality grid
- **Stability**: No frequent disconnections

## For Now

See related:
- [Grid Frequency Issues](../troubleshooting/grid-frequency-issues.md) - Troubleshooting
- [Grid Code Standards](../../concepts/grid-code-standards.md) - Understanding standards
- [Validate New Installation](../../tutorials/01-validate-new-installation.md) - Complete validation

## Coming Soon

- Grid quality measurement procedure
- Acceptable value tables by region
- Poor grid mitigation strategies
- Documentation templates
