# How-To: Identify Underperforming Sites

**Status**: 🚧 Coming Soon

This guide is planned for future implementation.

## What This Will Cover

- Statistical methods to identify outliers in fleet performance
- Benchmarking individual sites against fleet average
- Accounting for site-specific factors (location, weather, system size)
- Automated detection of degraded systems

## Problem

You need to find which installations are:
- Producing less energy than expected
- Experiencing abnormal battery degradation
- Having frequent faults or alarms
- Requiring maintenance attention

## For Now

See related:
- [Detect Battery Degradation](../anomaly-detection/detect-battery-degradation.md) - Battery health monitoring
- [Compare Site Performance](./compare-site-performance.md) - Site comparison methods
- [Why Monitor Batteries](../../concepts/why-monitor-batteries.md) - Business case

## Coming Soon

- Performance scoring algorithms
- Weather normalization techniques
- Outlier detection methods
- Automated reporting templates
