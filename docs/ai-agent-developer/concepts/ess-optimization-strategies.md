# Concept: ESS Optimization Strategies

**Status**: 🚧 Coming Soon

This guide is planned for future implementation.

## What This Will Cover

- Understanding different ESS optimization goals
- Tradeoffs: cost vs battery life vs grid support
- Peak shaving strategies
- Self-consumption maximization
- Grid arbitrage opportunities

## Why It Matters

Proper ESS optimization can:
- Reduce electricity bills by 30-50%
- Extend battery life by years
- Provide grid support services
- Maximize renewable energy use
