## What This Will Cover

- What grid codes are and why they exist
- Regional differences (EU, US, AU, etc.)
- How grid codes affect inverter operation
- Compliance requirements

## What Are Grid Codes?

Grid codes define:
- Acceptable voltage and frequency ranges
- Disconnection/reconnection timing
- Power quality requirements
- Anti-islanding protection

## Why It Matters

Wrong grid code setting causes:
- Frequent disconnections
- Compliance violations
- Grid instability
- Utility complaints

## For Now

- [Grid Code Table](../reference/grid-codes.md) - Quick reference
- [Validate New Installation](../tutorials/01-validate-new-installation.md) - Checking grid code

## Coming Soon

- Grid code comparison tables
- Regional requirement details
- Configuration examples
- Certification requirements
