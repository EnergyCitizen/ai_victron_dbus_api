# How-To: Implement Proactive Alerts

**Status**: 🚧 Coming Soon

This guide is planned for future implementation.

## What This Will Cover

- Agent-initiated notifications (not user-triggered queries)
- Threshold-based alerting systems
- Smart alert routing (SMS, email, Slack, etc.)
- Alert fatigue prevention strategies

## Problem

You want your AI agent to:
- Notify you BEFORE failures occur
- Send alerts only for important events
- Explain WHY the alert was triggered
- Suggest remediation actions

## For Now

- Threshold configuration
- Multi-channel notification code
- Alert deduplication logic
