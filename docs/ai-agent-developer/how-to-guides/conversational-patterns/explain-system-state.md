# How-To: Explain System State in Plain Language

**Status**: 🚧 Coming Soon

This guide is planned for future implementation.

## What This Will Cover

- Converting technical metrics to human-readable explanations
- Context-aware responses (installer vs end user language)
- Explaining complex states simply ("Why is my battery not charging?")
- Providing actionable next steps

## Problem

Users ask:
- "Is everything OK?" - How to answer comprehensively
- "Why did this alarm trigger?" - Explain root cause
- "What should I do?" - Suggest actions
- "Is this normal?" - Provide context

## For Now

- [2025 UX Patterns](../../../shared/conversational-ai/2025-ux-patterns.md) - Modern conversational UI
- [Critical Paths](../../reference/api/critical-paths.md) - What to monitor

## Coming Soon

- Response template library
- Context detection logic
- Explanation generation algorithms
- Multi-language support patterns
