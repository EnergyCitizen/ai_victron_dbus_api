# How-To: Detect Inverter Faults

**Status**: 🚧 Coming Soon

This guide is planned for future implementation.

## What This Will Cover

- Monitoring inverter health metrics
- Detecting temperature anomalies
- Identifying load imbalance in parallel configurations
- Early warning for inverter failures

## Problem

Inverter failures can cause:
- System downtime
- Load shedding
- Battery damage
- Safety issues

## For Now

- [Detect Battery Degradation](./detect-battery-degradation.md) - Similar monitoring patterns
- [Detect Grid Issues](./detect-grid-issues.md) - Grid-related faults
- [Inverter Load Imbalance](../../../installer/how-to-guides/troubleshooting/inverter-load-imbalance.md) - Parallel system issues

## Coming Soon

- Inverter health KPIs
- Temperature monitoring thresholds
- Load imbalance detection algorithms
- Predictive failure indicators
